# FIFA-Player-Data-Cleaning-Analysis-Visualization Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes FIFA player and team data to gain insights into player attributes, team rankings, and overall trends. It involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.

## 📂 Dataset
- **players.csv** – Contains player details like age, rating, nationality, and club.
- **teams.csv** – Contains team-related information.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization

## 🔍 Data Analysis Steps
1. **Importing the Dataset** – Load the `players.csv` and `teams.csv` files using Pandas.
2. **Exploring the Data**  
   - Display the first and last few rows of the dataset.
   - Check the shape (number of rows and columns).
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values by dropping or filling them appropriately.
   - Convert data types where necessary.
   - Standardize categorical variables.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identify key trends and insights from the dataset.
   - Perform aggregations (e.g., average player ratings per team).
5. **Data Visualization**  
   - Generate bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms to represent the data visually.
6. **Insight Extraction**  
   - Analyze trends and patterns based on visualizations.
   - Draw conclusions on team rankings, player performance, and national distributions.

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- **Top 10 Teams by Average Player Rating** 📈
- **Correlation Between Age & Player Rating** 🔄
- **Player Age Distribution** 📊
- **Top 10 Countries with Most Players** 🌍
- **Player Height vs. Weight Scatter Plot** ⚽

## 🔍 Insights & Findings
- **Top Teams:** Clubs with higher-rated players tend to perform better in leagues and tournaments.
- **Age vs. Rating:** There is a general trend where player ratings peak between 25-30 years.
- **Player Age Distribution:** Most players are in their early to mid-20s, aligning with peak performance periods.
- **Countries Representation:** Certain countries dominate FIFA rankings, contributing the most players.
- **Height & Weight Relation:** Taller players tend to have higher weights, influencing their playing position.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into FIFA player and team data, helping understand key trends in player performance, team rankings, and national representations. The findings can assist in scouting, team strategy, and football analytics.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implement machine learning models to predict player potential and performance.
- **Team Performance Analysis:** Analyze how team compositions impact match outcomes.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Create an interactive dashboard using **Power BI or Tableau** for better insights.
- **More Data Sources:** Integrate additional datasets, such as match statistics and player transfers.
- **Automated Data Updates:** Use web scraping to fetch live FIFA data for real-time insights.
